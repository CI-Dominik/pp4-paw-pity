## **USER EXPERIENCE**

## Target audience
* Our platform is designed for all pet owners and animal lovers who care deeply about the well-being of animals. Whether you've lost a pet, found one wandering alone, or simply want to help reunite families with their beloved companions, this website is for you. Together, we can make a difference in bringing lost pets back home.

## User's journey
* When users arrive at our website, they are welcomed with a clear and intuitive interface. The platform is divided into two main areas:

My Pets: Here, users can add detailed profiles for their pets. This includes essential information like their name, breed, and photos, making it easier to act quickly if a pet ever goes missing.
Missing Animals: This section showcases a list of pets that have been reported missing. Users can browse through the profiles, filter based on location or type, and provide helpful hints if theyâ€™ve seen a reported pet.
Every step of the way, the goal is to create a community that supports each other in reuniting with their beloved pets.

## Intuitive and consistent design
* The homepage embraces a simple, welcoming design with turquoise and white as the primary colors. These hues were chosen to evoke a sense of calm, trust, and compassion. The minimalist layout ensures that users can navigate easily without distractions, focusing on the core purpose of the site: helping lost animals find their way back home.

## **DEPLOYMENT**

## GitHub

### Visual Studio Code connection
* A connection between Visual Studio Code and GitHub was established using the built-in function to include the ability to clone, stage, commit and push content directly to GitHub.
Once you start Visual Studio Code with no connection, you simply need to click on the person icon in the lower left corner and select "GitHub". From there, you can connect your existing account to Visual Studio Code.

<br>

### Cloning, committing and pushing via Visual Studio Code
* Visual Studio code was used to stage all changed files and commit them with an included message directly to GitHub.

<br>

### Deployed page on GitHub
* The system is hosted via Heroku, but still available in the pages menu of GitHub.
